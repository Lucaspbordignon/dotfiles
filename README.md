# dotfiles
These are my default configuration files for my macOS systems.

## Softwares that I currently use
- iterm 2
- vim (the only choice)
- zshell
## Installing
As easy as making a good coffee with great beans. Simply run ```./apply``` and the script will clone, install and move the dependencies for the configs.

Note: you must have vim and zshell installed to note the differences.

## Linux support
Currently, the ```apply``` script is intended to install and move my dotfiles to the right places in a macOS system, but some files on this repository are from my linux systems, as i3, polybar and termite files.

To use them, one must simply install and move the files to the right places manually.
